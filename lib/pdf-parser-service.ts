          Kenya Sugar Board Unveils Ambitious 2025-2029 Strategic Plan

          NAIROBI, Kenya â€“ The Kenya Sugar Board (KSB) has officially launched its inaugural Draft Strategic Plan for the period 2025-2029. This landmark document sets a clear roadmap for revitalizing Kenya's sugar industry, aiming to transform it into a globally competitive sector that significantly improves livelihoods. The plan, developed following the KSB's re-establishment under the Sugar Act 2024, builds on past achievements and lessons learned, particularly from its time under the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA).

          The Strategic Plan is closely aligned with the Kenyan Government's economic development blueprints, including Kenya Vision 2030 and its Fourth Medium Term Plan, as well as the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development's policies. It also contributes to broader regional and international development frameworks, such as the East Africa Community (EAC) Vision 2050, African Union (AU) Agenda 2063, and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

          Despite the sugar industry's vital role, it faces significant challenges. These include occasional uncontrolled sugar imports, price distortions, high production costs, low productivity, inefficient operations, and the pervasive impact of climate change. However, the Government is committed to transforming the sector through legal, policy, and strategic interventions. This Strategic Plan prioritizes strengthening production efficiency and value addition to ensure enhanced benefits for all stakeholders.

          Vision Statement: "A world class facilitator of a globally competitive sugar industry for improved livelihood"

          Mission Statement: "To sustainably develop, promote and regulate the sugar industry for economic growth and transformation"

          Core Values (TIPIC):
          - Teamwork: Emphasizing collaborative efforts to achieve common goals within the industry.
          - Integrity: Upholding ethical and transparent operations across all aspects of the sugar industry.
          - Professionalism: Adhering to high standards of conduct and expertise in all activities.
          - Innovativeness: Encouraging new ideas and approaches to improve industry efficiency and sustainability.
          - Customer Focus: Prioritizing the needs and satisfaction of all stakeholders, including consumers, producers, and the public.

          Kenya's sugar industry has a rich history tracing back to the early 1900s with the introduction of sugarcane cultivation around Lake Victoria. The first sugar factory was established in Miwani, Kisumu County, in 1922. Post-independence, the industry expanded rapidly, solidifying sugarcane's position as the fourth major cash crop after horticulture, tea, and coffee.

          Current Industry Snapshot:
          - Operational Mills: Kenya currently boasts 17 licensed mills, with 15 actively operational.
          - Farmer Livelihoods: The industry supports over 350,000 farmers, with smallholders accounting for 94% across 15 counties. It sustains the livelihoods of an estimated nine million Kenyans.
          - Economic Contribution: Sugarcane contributes approximately 5.4% to agricultural GDP. In 2023, it accounted for 8.4% of the marketed value of all crops.
          - Production & Deficit: Despite expanding cane acreage from 126,826 hectares in 2002 to 293,303 hectares in 2024, sugar production reached 815,454 Metric Tonnes (MT) in 2023. However, national consumption stood at 1.14 million MT in 2024, resulting in a 30% production deficit.

          Five Strategic Issues Requiring Urgent Response:
          1. Sub-optimal factory sugar production, and declining farm-level productivity of cane
          2. The need for strong regulatory framework and enforcement that ensures compliance
          3. Weak linkage of research, innovation, diversification, and modern technology adoption
          4. Mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues in the industry
          5. Inadequate institutional resources, capacity, and governance systems

          Ten Strategic Objectives:
          1. To facilitate an increase in national average sugarcane yield to 80 TCH by 2030
          2. To promote growth and efficiency in national sugar production
          3. To create an enabling legal and regulatory framework for the sugar industry
          4. To establish a robust compliance and enforcement system
          5. To provide credible industry data for informed decision-making
          6. To achieve a diversified sugar industry driven by research, innovation, and strategic partnerships
          7. To enhance institutional governance, resilience and performance of sugarcane farmers' organizations
          8. To promote an environmentally responsible, socially inclusive and well-governed sugar industry value chain
          9. To sustain a well-resourced, efficient, and adaptive institution
          10. To improve service delivery through operational efficiency and effectiveness

          The Strategic Plan's total estimated cost over the planning period is Ksh 38.43 billion, inclusive of administration expenses. However, the projected financial inflow is Ksh 35.0 billion, leaving an anticipated financial resource gap of Ksh 3.4 billion.

          Implementation Framework includes robust risk management and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (MER) frameworks. Independent mid-term evaluation will be conducted in January 2028, and an end-term evaluation in June 2030.

          How Agroforestry and Carbon Markets are Transforming Farming in Eastern Kenya
          
          An in-depth analysis of how agroforestry practices and carbon market mechanisms are revolutionizing agricultural methods in Eastern Kenya, leading to improved sustainability and farmer incomes.
          
          Executive Summary:
          Agroforestry systems in Eastern Kenya are demonstrating remarkable potential for transforming smallholder farming through integrated tree-crop systems that enhance both productivity and environmental sustainability. This research examines the intersection of agroforestry practices with emerging carbon market opportunities, highlighting how farmers are accessing new revenue streams while contributing to climate change mitigation.
          
          Key findings indicate that agroforestry adoption has increased farmer incomes by an average of 35% over traditional monocropping systems, while simultaneously improving soil fertility, water retention, and biodiversity conservation. Carbon credit programs are providing additional financial incentives, with participating farmers earning between $15-30 per hectare annually through verified carbon sequestration.
          
          The research methodology involved comprehensive field studies across three counties in Eastern Kenya - Machakos, Makueni, and Kitui - examining 450 smallholder farms over a three-year period. Data collection included productivity measurements, income analysis, carbon sequestration calculations, and farmer interviews to assess adoption barriers and success factors.
          
          Results demonstrate that successful agroforestry implementation requires integrated support systems including technical training, access to quality seedlings, market linkages for tree products, and simplified carbon credit registration processes. Government policy support and NGO partnerships have been crucial enablers of large-scale adoption.
          
          Climate resilience benefits are particularly significant in the semi-arid conditions of Eastern Kenya, where agroforestry systems provide crucial protection against drought, improved water infiltration, and reduced soil erosion. Tree species selection focuses on indigenous varieties that provide multiple benefits including fodder, timber, fruits, and medicinal uses.
          
          Carbon market participation has evolved from voluntary to compliance markets, with increasing standardization of measurement, reporting, and verification protocols. Digital monitoring tools are reducing transaction costs and improving access for smallholder farmers through aggregated community-based approaches.
          
          Economic analysis reveals that while initial establishment costs average $200-400 per hectare, break-even typically occurs within 3-5 years, with long-term returns exceeding 200% over 10-year periods. Revenue diversification through tree products, improved crop yields, and carbon payments creates more resilient household economies.
          
          Social benefits include enhanced food security, improved nutrition through fruit and vegetable production, reduced labor requirements for women and children in fuel wood collection, and strengthened community cooperation through farmer group participation in carbon programs.
          
          Environmental impacts extend beyond carbon sequestration to include improved watershed management, enhanced biodiversity conservation, reduced agrochemical use, and restoration of degraded landscapes. Ecosystem services valuation indicates total benefits of $500-800 per hectare annually when all environmental services are quantified.
          
          Scaling challenges include limited access to finance for initial investments, complex certification processes for carbon credits, market volatility for tree products, and insufficient extension services for technical support. Policy recommendations focus on streamlined carbon credit procedures, micro-finance access, and integrated agricultural advisory services.
          
          Future opportunities include expansion to additional counties, integration with other climate-smart agriculture practices, development of regional carbon credit aggregation platforms, and establishment of value-added processing facilities for agroforestry products.
          
          Conclusion: Agroforestry combined with carbon market participation represents a transformative approach to sustainable agricultural development in Eastern Kenya, offering viable pathways for climate adaptation, economic development, and environmental conservation.
