# Judiciary Portal Image Requirements

To complete the transformation from a sugar industry dashboard to a judiciary portal, the following image files need to be created or updated:

## Required Image Files

1. `/images/judiciary-emblem.png` - The national emblem/coat of arms for the judiciary
2. `/images/judiciary-logo.png` - The official judiciary logo
3. `/icon.png` - Update the favicon for the portal

## Additional Images Needed

- Replace sugar industry-related images in the resource center and other components
- Create appropriate imagery for case management, judgments, and other judiciary-specific content
- Consider updating placeholder images to reflect judicial themes

## Color Theme

The current color scheme (primarily green) may be appropriate for the judiciary, but consider these judiciary-specific colors if needed:
- Navy blue (traditional judicial color)
- Deep burgundy/maroon (often used in judicial contexts)
- Gold/yellow accents (for official seals and emblems)
